### Art feature

This month we relaunched our brand with a new logo, website and supporting artwork. In order to have a fully rounded package of graphics to use for our new branding we also produced a relaunch trailer, featuring a futuristic car zooming towards a cyberpunk remix version of Perth. Elements of this animation are reused on the new Open Studios website as backgrounds and social media accounts as banners.

Modelled and rendered in Blender and then finished with DaVinci Resolve, this was a lot of fun to make and set the tone for our new branding. We’re working on an extended version which will feature clips of our other work.

Check out the To Another World video:

### Garrett Ray Jewellery

The scales represent balance and harmony, two important aspects of a Libra’s personality. Charming and peaceful, Libra’s value balance in all things. Governing from September 23 to October 23.

Jewellery isn’t just something pretty to wear out, it can tell the world a bit about who you are and what you value. The right piece can also be empowering, even protective. In that spirit we promoted the sunstone shield pendant necklace, symbolising the protection of ones happiness.

A beacon of hope and aspiration. In these uncertain times, let the [18K Gold Oregon Sunstone pendant](https://grayjewellery.com.au/products/walnut-oregon-suntone-and-18k-gold-pendant-necklace) be your shield.

### Tech insight

When Three.JS hit the scene over a decade ago, it made waves in web development unlocking a whole new realm for developers who could write Javascript to begin making their own 3D applications. The adoption of Three.JS has been steady, but slow going in our view. In an effort to popularise current WebGL technology and show our ability to use Three.JS, we made our entire website a high end experience that you’d normally only see in an AAA video game.
