There’s a lot of options to choose from when it comes to 3D files however when it comes to distributing assets for the web like a Three.JS scene then GLB is a clear winner. In our most recent Three.JS project we had a lot of problems trying to compress FBX and OBJ down to acceptabe sizes for an online scene. FBX and OBJ are established formats that are common in online marketplaces for 3D assets but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re fit for purpose when it comes to 3D on the web.

Switching to GLB helped yield a significant file size drop while maintaining the essence of the geometry when imported and rendered in Three.JS.
