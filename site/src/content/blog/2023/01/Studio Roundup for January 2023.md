This is an exciting year for Open Studios — a lot of hard work and setup is now starting to pay off as we enter our fourth year of operation.

### Demonology

Introducing a new original cartoon about the life and times of two young demons growing up in hell. The concept is currently with our capable art team who are studying old school cartoons and coming up with the look.

The original [Daemonologie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemonologie) published by King James was basically a political attack on alternative religion at the time. That attack had a huge impact on the course of human history until this day.

The witch trials which took place around the world can be traced back to the slanderous claims in Daemonologie. The entirety of the Shakespeare play MacBeth was written as a bit of ego stroking for ol’ King James — the entire plot built around making his enemies look evil/stupid and him highly capable and righteous.

Demonology is going to de-mystify the dark world for today’s age, showing that “demons” and “witches” are just people, maybe on their worst day. What makes you good or evil isn’t what you are — it’s who you decide to be.

In the third quarter of 2022 we performed a competitor analysis on the website — looking at how our website stacks up to industry leaders who have been in the biz for decades. These changes elevated the site from just a generic Shopify site to the Garrett Ray Jewellery of today.

<p><em>In the lead up to being in British Vogue, we produced a video ad just to set the tone of the jewellery brand. Video advertising is definitely going to be a space we explore more as we build our video production capability.</em></p>

And finally we’re excited to announce the release of two new jewellery collections — [The Diamond Classics](https://grayjewellery.com.au/collections/diamond-classics) and [The Zodiac Collection](https://grayjewellery.com.au/collections/zodiac-collection).

### Kamigen

The entire [Kamigen](http://kamigen.com/) project is undergoing an art rebuild, although it’s not at the top of our priorities right now as there is just \*so much\* to do here.

Previously Kamigen was rapidly produced on a monthly basis in order to generate unique story and art for a more advanced production. We have recently begun that. Here’s a sneak peek at a new trailer and some of the new comics pages, we hope you love the new look as much as we do!

<p><em>Given the new level of art we can make now, the animation aspect of the project was brought forward. This test footage is the start of that production. Made with Blender and love.Joe’s introduction in the new comic, this is still concept art and not final.</em></p>
