          <h3>This website</h3>
          <p>We relaunched our studio brand looking to demonstrate our capabilities in terms of creativity and technical execution. But more importantly, this is our epicentre.</p>
          <p>The new studio website is designed to cause shockwaves by being something different but also familiar. We want you to feel like you've walked into a real office where we do our work.</p>
          <p> On the technical side we've implemented automatic scaling of viewport and performance so the website works on all devices.</p>
