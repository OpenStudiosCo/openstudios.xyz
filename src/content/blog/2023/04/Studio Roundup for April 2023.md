We’ve reached the end of our 2023 Summer print campaign in British Vogue, but the work of a marketing agency is never done! Taurus season began on April 20 and as such we promoted this bold design across all of Garrett Ray Jewellery’s socials.

### Kamigen

Auditing the current workflow for comics production — we noticed a glaring omission that has now been rectified. There wasn’t a scaffold to bring everything together — we had three different character stories on the go but hadn’t combined them into a storyboard for the new comic.

This has now been rectified, here’s a sneak peek at the first few pages!

The challenge of managing files assets is an ongoing one in media production. Kamigen itself has evolved from being an RPG with a comic, to just a comic to the multimedia production that it is today. The folder system on this project reflects that with too many disparate folders in the root.
