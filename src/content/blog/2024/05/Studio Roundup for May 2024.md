### Langenium progress
After over a decade of being limited to keyboard and mouse only controls, we're pleased to announced the Langenium game will soon have on-screen controls. Players will be able to control their aircraft speed, position and look around with the camera on any device.

With touch controls implemented, we wanted there to be a stronger sense of travel speed and so we began to implement an afterburner thruster effect on the game's primary aircraft. First looking at special effects libraries listed by THREE.JS, ultimately going with three-nebula due to the appeal of a desktop tool to design the new effect. While it was easy enough to build an effect using their tool, there were issues integrating the three-nebula library with the latest three.js version. In the end sprite particle effects code from the v4 build of Langenium was migrated into the new v6 codebase, allowing for a rudimentary thruster effect.
