                <h3>What is Open Studios?</h3>
                <div class="ui very relaxed bulleted list">
                  <div class="item">A private company based in Australia that produces open source digital media, software and games</div>
                  <div class="item">A document driven organisation that uses Git repositories for process.</div>

                <h3>Why open source?</h3>
                <div class="ui very relaxed bulleted list">
                  <div class="item">Developers are writing variations of the same solution over and over again across different industries and applications. </div>
                  <div class="item">Closed source approaches to software and games development prevent the team from receiving benefits that open source receives including knowledge sharing with peers and can limit the team to working with an unpopular and buggy tech stack that affects their work.</div>
                  <div class="item">A game is a cross disciplinary product that pushes the boundaries of technology, but that also makes it challenging to develop. Working with open source means the developers aren’t restricted from looking for help from the global community, and there is much help.</div>
                  <div class="item">The configurability of open source means that there will be no limitations to future improvements and maintenance of Open Studios software.</div>
